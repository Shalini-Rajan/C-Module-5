# # Pointers: Division of Two Numbers Using Pointers in C

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a C program that performs the division of two numbers using pointers.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Declare** integer variables `a`, `b`, and `sub`, and pointers `c`, `d`.
2. **Read** values for `a` and `b` from the user.
3. **Assign** the addresses of `a` and `b` to the pointers `c` and `d` respectively.
4. **Calculate** the quotient by dereferencing the pointers:
   ```c
   sub = *c / *d;
5. Print the result (quotient) stored in sub.

## Program
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a, b, sub;
    int *c, *d;
    printf("Enter two integers (dividend and divisor): ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    c = &a;
    d = &b;
    if (*d == 0) {
        printf("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n");
        return 1; // Exit with error
    }
    sub = *c / *d;
    printf("Quotient = %d\n", sub);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
Enter two integers (dividend and divisor): 10 2
Quotient = 5
```


## Result
The above programme is implemented and executed.
